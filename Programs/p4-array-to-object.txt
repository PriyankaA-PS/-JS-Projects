1. Spread Operator
-- use its ... into {} which spreads its message by giving default key values

2. Reduce method of array
-- for me its look like Array Function assign with variable 
-- (acc, currentValue, index)
-- -- acc - {}/ object
-- -- currentValue is the Values ('Hello')
-- -- index is currentValue indexed [0,1,2]
** acc[index] acts as key only in Javascript
